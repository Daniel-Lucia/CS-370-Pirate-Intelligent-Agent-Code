# CS-370-Pirate-Intelligent-Agent-

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:

What code were you given?

We were given three code files that were preconstructed with the Treasure hunt game setup code: GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. 

What code did you create yourself?

As for the code that I created myself that was completing the the Q-training algorithm code block. This was to help finish out the functionality for the Pirate Intelligent Agent by applying a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve the pathfinding problem of the maze.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists play a critical role in addressing and resolving complex problems through the use of advanced technology. Their work involves applying principles of computer science and engineering to develop innovative solutions that enhance efficiency, productivity, and performance across various industries. They are responsible for designing and implementing algorithms, software, and hardware systems that can process, store, and transmit large volumes of data. Additionally, computer scientists collaborate with other professionals to identify the most effective approaches to problem-solving and work to improve the overall performance of technology systems. Their work is vital in ensuring that technology remains relevant and effective in improving the lives of people worldwide.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approached any problem by analyzing it from a technical perspective. I take into account all the available resources at my disposal and use my knowledge to efficiently solve the problem. Through careful consideration and practical application of my skills, I am usually able to find a suitable solution that addressed all the requirements of the task.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As professionals in the field of computer science, it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that the systems we build and develop do not cause harm to the end user or the organization we serve. The course that I have completed has provided me with a deeper understanding of the ethical obligations that machine learning developers have towards their customers and end users. It is important to be aware of these obligations and take them seriously, as the impact of our work can have far-reaching consequences on society. We must always aim to create systems that are helpful, fair, and safe, and take steps to mitigate any potential risks or negative outcomes that may arise.
