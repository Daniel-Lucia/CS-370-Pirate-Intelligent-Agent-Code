# CS-370 Pirate Intelligent Agent Code

This repo contains code and a report from my time in the Current and Emerging Trends course. This course focused on advanced, fast-evolving topics in the Computer Science field, with a heavy emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and ethical implications. I learned about Deep Q-learning, reinforcement learning, and comparing AI to human intelligence. I also worked in a virtual environment (Apporto) on AI projects, training neural networks in Keras to navigate mazes or control agents in pre-constructed games.
